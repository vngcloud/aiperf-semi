            branch_orchestrator: Optional DAG subagent orchestrator. When
                provided, non-overflow credit returns are offered to
                ``orchestrator.intercept`` before the strategy's
                ``handle_credit_return`` is called. If intercept returns True
                the strategy dispatch is suppressed (the orchestrator has taken
                over the next-turn path by spawning children / queuing a join
                turn). Context-overflow terminals skip intercept entirely so
                ``on_root_terminal`` / overflow recycle / warmup-failure
                handling still run.
            session_tree_registry: Optional per-tree session-slot ledger (agentic
                replay only). When engaged (PROFILING), the depth-0 root session
                slot is NOT released on the root's terminal return -- it is held
                until the whole tree drains. The release is deferred to
                ``registry.on_root_terminal`` (after intercept for authored-final
                turns, so final-turn spawns are counted first); terminal means
                the authored final turn or a context-overflow early abort. The
                per-phase teardown releases any still-open trees via the
                runner's ``release_all``.
            on_warmup_abort: Optional async callback fired ONCE on the first
                terminal WARMUP failure. Used by agentic replay to abort the run
                early (broadcast ProfileCancelCommand) instead of letting warmup
                drain to teardown -- a degraded trajectory pool means PROFILING

        AgenticReplayStrategy exposes ``record_warmup_failure(trace_id, error)``,
        returning False when the error was a context-overflow (the trace was
        dropped from the pool instead of counted as a failure) so this method
        must not live-abort on it either. PhaseRunner calls
        ``report_warmup_failures()`` at WARMUP teardown to abort PROFILING if
        any trajectory burned its only warmup credit on a real terminal error
        or cancellation. Duck-typed: only fires when the active strategy
        implements the hook, so non-replay strategies are unaffected.

        Do NOT gate on ``credit.is_final_turn``: a WARMUP credit primes the single
        turn k_i (the last request before t*), and PROFILING resumes the same
        trajectory at k_i+1, so for a session active at t* the warmed turn is never
        the trajectory's final turn (k_i < num_turns-1) and ``is_final_turn`` is
        False. WARMUP dispatches exactly one credit per session and its return is a
        strategy-level no-op, so every WARMUP root return IS the terminal warmup
        event for that trajectory -- gating on ``is_final_turn`` made this
        accumulation dead for the entire normal warmup population, silently letting
        a degraded pool proceed to PROFILING.

        When ``on_warmup_abort`` is wired, the FIRST terminal failure also aborts
        the run live (broadcast ProfileCancelCommand) instead of waiting the full
        warmup drain for the teardown-time ``report_warmup_failures`` raise: a
        single failure already breaks the contract, and the broadcast cancels
        in-flight warmup and drives a clean records-manager + system-controller
        shutdown. Fired at most once; on broadcast failure the trigger flag resets
